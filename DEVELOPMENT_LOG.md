### 4. Tower Preservation & Repositioning System
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Problem Solved:** Players were losing all towers between levels, making progression impossible.

**Solution Implemented:**

#### Level Transition Flow:
1. Complete wave 25 of a level
2. All towers **saved with their upgrade levels**
3. Board clears for new map
4. **Placement mode activates**
5. Player repositions towers on new map
6. Click "✅ Ready - Start Waves" to continue

#### Features:
- **Tower Inventory Tracking:** Counts each tower type owned
- **Upgrade Preservation:** Towers keep their levels (1-4) between maps
- **Visual Indicators:**
  - Buttons show tower count with star indicators (e.g., "🧙‍♂️ x2" with "★★ ★★★")
  - Banner: "📍 TOWER PLACEMENT & UPGRADE"
  - Message: "Your towers keep their upgrade levels!"
- **No Gold Cost:** Repositioning uses inventory, not gold
- **Hero Reset:** Hero can be placed again on new map

#### UI Changes:
- Placement mode disables wave starting
- Shows "Ready" button instead of "Start Wave"
- Tower buttons switch from showing cost to showing inventory
- Upgrade/sell disabled during placement

**Files Modified:** `tower_defense_fixed.html`, `index.html`

---

## Design Philosophy

**Core Principles:**
1. **Strategic Depth** - Tower variety forces planning
2. **Progression** - Keep upgrades between levels (player investment matters)
3. **Memorable Moments** - Epic bosses make each level climactic
4. **Fair Challenge** - Slowed enemies give time to react
5. **Humor** - Giant Robot, Spider Queen with babies adds personality

**Immunity System:**
Each tower has ONE enemy type it can't damage:
- Wizard → can't hurt Goblins (magic resistant)
- Archer → can't hurt Armored Orcs (arrows bounce off)
- Ninja → can't hurt Scouts (too fast)
- Cannon → can't hurt Wyverns (too agile)
- Catapult → no immunities
- Hero → no immunities (support tower)

This forces tower diversity and strategic placement.

## Code Patterns to Maintain

### Adding New Enemy Types:
```javascript
enemyTypes: {
    newEnemy: {
        name: "🎯 Name",
        baseHealth: 100,
        baseSpeed: 1.0,
        color: '#HEXCOLOR',
        size: 14,
        abilities: ['ability_name'],
        immunities: ['towerType'],
        liveDamage: 5
    }
}
```

### Adding New Tower Types:
```javascript
towerTypes: {
    newTower: {
        name: "🎯 Tower Name",
        baseCost: 100,
        upgrades: [
            { damage: 50, range: 100, fireRate: 1000, color: '#HEX', effect: 'effectName' },
            // ... 4 levels total
        ]
    }
}
```

### Modifying Paths:
Each map has its own `path` array in `mapData`. Paths are arrays of `{x, y}` coordinates.
